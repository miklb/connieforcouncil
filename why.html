            <h1>Why I Support Connie Burton</h1>
            <p>I had been following local government at all levels and trying to find where I could offer some help. What ever that looked like. Two failed attempts later in mid-January I reached out to an old mutual friend to introduce me to Connie Burton.
                On February 11 I reached out to Ms Burton to offer my help in any way I could on the issues she was fighting for. </p>
            <p>She has been the single consistent voice speaking truth to power at every opportunity for public comment. As well as during her time as citizen representative on the county housing advisory board. At her last appearance before the CRA board
                as president of the East Tampa CRA CAC every single council member told her she was right and acknowledged the affect she has had on them.</p>
            <p>After a few phone calls and text exchanges, we met and she laid out her goals. The first step as I saw it was to start scheduling one-on-one appointments with folks to help them apply for housing rehab through county programs. Probably build
                a small info site to streamline the UX for folks with limited technology and bandwidth. Find out where the pain points were and try to see if what every agency that was were open to some user testing feedback. Basically the <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/codeforamerica-cms1/documents/CfA-Digital-Outreach-Playbook-2018.pdf">playbook Code for America ran</a>                with CalFresh.</p>
            <p>Then the unexpected.</p>
            <p>She told me she was considering applying and I couldn't think of a better person for right now to be on this council. I had a conversation with a few people Ms Burton introduced me to on March 18 and bought the domain afterward. On the 22nd
                I started pulling some content together from several shared documents and <a href="https://github.com/miklb/connieforcouncil">wrote some html</a>.</p>
