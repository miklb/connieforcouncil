                        Connie Burton will be a balancing force that can genuinely advocate for sensible policies, primarily through budget reform, awarding of City of Tampa contracts, observation of development connected to rational and rational policies that aren't overwhelming
                        to established residents, and making sure that the City Council Representatives exercise the rights, duties, and responsibilities the People entrusted and elected us to perform.

                    Considering the facts of our daily 2022 existence as we are confronted with active forces that are adamant about reversing the gains of the Civil Rights Movement: equality, women's rights, gender rights, citizens' rights, religious rights, religious tolerance,
                    racial tolerance, health care, housing availability, birthrights, criminal reform, access to healthcare, and most of all transparency and accountability in government.

                <h3>In her own words.</h3>
                <p>“We are confronted with active forces that are adamant about reversing the gains of the Civil Rights Movement,” says Burton, who boasts over 40 years of experience in grassroots organizing and advocacy. She pledges to stand against all
                    forms of intolerance, and focus her work on gender, citizens, birth and religious rights; housing availability; criminal justice reform; access to healthcare; and transparency and accountability in government.
                </p>
                <p>“Ironically, since the departure of Yvonne Yolie Capin from Tampa City Council, Tampa City Council has not had any female representatives. The six men that make up the current membership of Tampa City Council are all fair minded and dedicated
                    but the addition of one female voice will certainly add a degree of diversity that is much needed.”
