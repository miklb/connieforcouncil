                        Connie Burton will be a balancing force that can genuinely advocate for sensible policies, primarily through budget reform, awarding of City of Tampa contracts, observation of development connected to rational and rational policies that aren't overwhelming
                        to established residents, and making sure that the City Council Representatives exercise the rights, duties, and responsibilities the People entrusted and elected us to perform.

                            <p>“We are confronted with active forces that are adamant about reversing the gains of the Civil Rights Movement. Ironically, since the departure of Yvonne Yolie Capin from Tampa City Council, Tampa City Council has not had any
                                female representatives. The six men that make up the current membership of Tampa City Council are all fair minded and dedicated but the addition of one female voice will certainly add a degree of diversity that is much
                                needed.”
