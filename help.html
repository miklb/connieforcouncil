            <h1>How to Help <br> Appoint Connie Burton to Tampa City Council</h1>

            <p>First, thank you for your interest in advocating for Connie. We are providing a Google form you can submit which we will print and deliver to Council the morning of April 5 before they vote. We also encourage you to contact your city council
                members (links to come) and let them know why they should vote for Connie.
            </p>
